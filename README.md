***Coding Challenge***

Your non-technical boss has requested a hint feature to be built.  The feature should be done like the Go app "Tsumego Pro". For simplicity,
the first version of the hint feature can just display the next correct move to the user, instead of also displaying the next wrong move like Tsumego Pro.

You may find downloading Tsumego Pro, exploring the website online-go.com, and exploring the submodule online-go.com useful for this feature.

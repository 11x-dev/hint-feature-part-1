***CodeSandbox Setup***:

Codesandbox should automatically install the packages and start the dev server.  If not, navigate to the hamburger menu on the left, and click "Terminal" -> then click "New Terminal"

Use the following command from the root of the project (where you should be by default)

```
yarn install && npm run dev
```

If the server just needs to be started, instead of the yarn install portion, you can simply do:

```
npm run dev
```

***Viewing Website***:

Assuming the above succeeded and the dev server is running, you'll want to view this website in a separate tab, as the preview will likely be either too small, or appear too squished.  First, locate the port the server is running on, by clicking "PORTS" which is to the right of "TERMINAL". Locate the port that ends with "18888".  Right click it, and click "Open in Browser" -> Click "Open" to confirm.

If you want to try opening the preview in CodeSandbox (perhaps you have a large monitor), navigate to the "CodeSandbox" section in the left navigation, which is just below the search icon, hover over the 18888 which is under the "Previews" section, and click the triangle icon to load the preview.

***Adjusting Theme***

You may want to change the default theme in CodeSandbox. Click the Gear icon ("Manage" when hovered) in the bottom left corner -> "Themes" -> "Color Theme"
